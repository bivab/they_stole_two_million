HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Use the arrow keys to move the player arround on the screen when approaching an
object pressing A reveals the actions provided by the object. With the number
showed left of the action you can trigger it. During the action the player is
blocked from doing anything else, the action's duration is shown on the right
of the action name.

Most object can be opened or smashed. Smashing is faster but consumes energy.
You can recover energy by drinking water from a dispenser, which isn't free, so
you need to "collect" some money first.

The goal of the game is to sneak in the a building an steal as much money as
you possible can from desks, safes and showcases without beeing caught by the
patrolling guards. Once you are rich enough you have to return to your car an
leave the scene. All this has to be acomplished before your time runs out and
the alarm goes of.
